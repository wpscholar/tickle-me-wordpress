A fun security plugin that returns 'Oh... that tickles!' instead of error messages on failed login.

== Description ==

Tickle Me WordPress is a fun security plugin.  As of WordPress 3.0 and higher, the WordPress login form shakes back and forth on failed logins.  Rather than return helpful error messages to potential hackers, this plugin returns the message "Oh... that tickles!" instead.

== Installation ==

Installation is easy:

* Copy the folder `tickle-me-wordpress` to the plugins directory of your blog.

== Screenshots ==

1. The login screen will dislplay 'Oh... that tickles!' on failed login.  Since the login box shakes back and forth on failed login attempts in WordPress 3.0 an higher, this is a fun way of hiding error messages from potential hackers.
